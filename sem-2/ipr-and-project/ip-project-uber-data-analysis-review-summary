The paper explains the working of an Uber dataset of New York City.
The dataset includes primary data on Uber pickups with details including
the date, time of the ride as well as longitude-latitude
information , Using the information, the paper explains the
use of the k-means clustering algorithm on the set of data and
classify the various parts of New York City. S ince the
industry is booming and expected to grow shortl y. Effective
taxi dispatching will facilitate each driver and passenger to
reduce the wait time to seek out one another. The model is
employed to predict the demand on points of the city


Case study of central London area

Case study of uber data in the central London.
1) uber data analysis explores multiple levels of depth through, different visualisation of the data, from chart and graph to an tableau analysis.
2) this analysis also provides multiple explanation for anomalies in the data and provide reasoning for increased traffic surge pricing during certain time and days.
3) research into uber's algorithm including a study published by the most recent writer of uber algorithm, suggest that the algorithm relied solely on when demand cannot meet supply.

1) real time big data analysis is still a challenging problem that needs to be addressed big data is more complex
2) big data analytics is the method of analysing massive data sets to highlight trends and patterns.
3) uber is using real time big data to perfect it's processes, from calculating Uber's pricing to finding the optimal positioning of the taxis to maximize profits.
4) the future development will consist of popular uber locations on google map .
