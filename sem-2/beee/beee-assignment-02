1. Why is  induced emf in a dc motor called the back or counter emf?

The induced emf in a DC motor is called the back/counter emf because it opposes the applied voltage emf that is powering the motor. When a DC voltage is applied to the motor, the current flows through the armature coil, which produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field interacts with the magnetic field of the stator, causing the armature to rotate.





2. What for brushes are employed in DC machines?

Brushes are employed in DC machines to facilitate the transfer of electrical power between the stationary and rotating parts of the machine. 

// Specifically, in a DC motor, the brushes are used to transfer electrical current from the power source to the rotating commutator, which in turn 
// delivers current to the armature windings





3. Why are series dc motors always started on Load

Series DC motors are always started on load because it has a high starting torque and a low starting current, which makes it suitable for starting under load. Starting a series motor on load ensures that the motor does not accelerate too quickly, which could cause damage to the motor or the driven load.




4.The power input to a 230 V dc shunt motor is 8,477 KW. The field resistance is 230 ohm and armature resistance is 0.28 ohm. Find the input current , armature current and back emf

We can use the following equations to solve this problem:

Power input = VI
Back emf (Eb) = V - IaRa
Power input = Power output + losses
Power output = Eb*Ia

where:
V = supply voltage = 230 V
I = input current (unknown)
Eb = back emf (unknown)
Ia = armature current (unknown)
Ra = armature resistance = 0.28 ohm
Pinput = power input = 8.477 KW = 8477 W
Poutput = power output (unknown)
losses = power losses (unknown)
Rf = field resistance = 230 ohm

First, we can calculate the input current:

Pinput = V * I
I = Pinput / V
I = 8477 W / 230 V
I = 36.88 A

Therefore, the input current is 36.88 A.

Next, we can calculate the back emf:

Back emf (Eb) = V - Ia * Ra
We need to find Ia to calculate Eb, which can be found using the power equations:

Power output = Eb * Ia
Power input = Power output + losses

The losses in the motor can be assumed to be 10% of the input power (this is a typical assumption for a shunt motor). Therefore, we can write:

Losses = 0.1 * Pinput = 0.1 * 8477 W = 847.7 W

Now we can solve for Ia:

Power output = Eb * Ia
Power output = (V - Ia * Ra) * Ia
Power output = VIa - Ia^2Ra
Ia^2Ra - VIa + Power output = 0

This is a quadratic equation in Ia. We can solve for Ia using the quadratic formula:

Ia = (-(-V) ± sqrt((-V)^2 - 4RaPower output))/(2Ra)
Ia = (V ± sqrt(V^2 - 4RaPower output))/(2Ra)

We take the positive root because Ia must be positive (current flows into the motor through the positive terminal). Plugging in the values:

Ia = (230 V + sqrt((230 V)^2 - 40.28 ohm * Poutput))/(20.28 ohm)
Ia = (230 V + sqrt(52900 V^2 - 1.12*Poutput))/(0.56 ohm)

Now we can substitute this expression for Ia in the power input equation and solve for Power output:

Power input = Power output + losses
8477 W = Power output + 847.7 W
Power output = 7629.3 W

Substituting this value of Power output in the equation for Ia:

Ia = (230 V + sqrt((230 V)^2 - 4*0.28 ohm * 7629.3 W))/(0.56 ohm)
Ia = 34.63 A

Now we can calculate the back emf:

Eb = V - Ia*Ra
Eb = 230 V - 34.63 A * 0.28 ohm
Eb = 220.26 V

Therefore, the input current is 36.88 A, the armature current is 34.63 A, and the back emf is 220.26 V.




5. A 250 v dc shunt motor takes 30 A current while running at full load. The resistance of motor armature and field windings are 0.1 ohm and 200 ohm. Determine the back emf generated in motor, when it runs on full load

We can use the following formula to calculate the back emf (Eb) generated by a DC motor:

Eb = V - Ia * Ra

where V is the supply voltage, Ia is the armature current, and Ra is the armature resistance.

Given:

    V = 250 V (supply voltage)
    Ia = 30 A (armature current)
    Ra = 0.1 ohm (armature resistance)

	Eb = V - Ia * Ra
	Eb = 247 V

Therefore, the back emf generated by the motor when it is running at full load is 247 V.




6. How can the direction of rotation of a dc series motor be changed

The direction of rotation of a DC series motor can be changed by reversing the polarity of either the armature current or the field current




7. Find the running speed of a 4-pole induction motor working on 50 Hz supply having 3% slip.

The running speed of an induction motor can be calculated using the following formula:

Ns = 120 * f / p

Ns = 120 * 50 / 4
Ns = 1500 RPM

Nr = Ns - Slip / 100% * Ns
Nr = Ns - 0.03 * Ns
Nr = 0.97 * Ns
Nr = 0.97 * 1500
Nr = 1455 RPM

Therefore, the running speed of the 4-pole induction motor with 3% slip is 1455 RPM




8. A three phase induction motor has 2 poles and is connected to 400 V , 50 Hz supply. Calculate the actual rotor speed and rotor speed and rotor frequency when the slip is 4%.

Ns = 120 * f / p

Ns = 120 * 50 / 2
Ns = 3000 RPM

When the motor is running, the actual rotor speed (Nr) is lower than the synchronous speed due to slip. The slip (S) is defined as the difference between the synchronous speed and the actual rotor speed divided by the synchronous speed, expressed as a percentage:

S = (Ns - Nr) / Ns * 100%

S = 4%
Nr = Ns * (1 - S / 100%)
Nr = 3000 * (1 - 4 / 100)
Nr = 2880 RPM


fr = S * fs

fr = 4% * 50 Hz
fr = 2 Hz

Therefore, the actual rotor speed of the motor is 2880 RPM and the rotor frequency is 2 Hz when the slip is 4%.





9. A 3-phase 50 Hz induction motor has a full load speed of 14,00 rpm. For this motor calculate slip, number of poles and speed of rotor field with respect to stator field.

The synchronous speed of an induction motor is given by:

Ns = 120 * f / p

where Ns is the synchronous speed in RPM, f is the supply frequency in Hz, and p is the number of poles.

In this case, we know that the motor is a 3-phase 50 Hz induction motor and has a full load speed of 1400 RPM. The synchronous speed can be calculated as follows:

Ns = 120 * 50 / p

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the number of poles:

p = 120 * 50 / Ns

p = 120 * 50 / 1400

p = 4.29

Since the number of poles must be an integer, we can round up to the nearest integer to get the number of poles as 4.

The actual speed of the motor rotor is lower than the synchronous speed due to slip. The slip is defined as the difference between the synchronous speed and the actual rotor speed divided by the synchronous speed, expressed as a percentage:

S = (Ns - Nr) / Ns * 100%

We know that the full load speed of the motor is 1400 RPM, so we can calculate the slip as follows:

S = (Ns - Nr) / Ns * 100%
S = (Ns - 1400) / Ns * 100%
S = (1500 - 1400) / 1500 * 100%
S = 6.67%

Therefore, the slip of the motor is 6.67%.

The speed of the rotor field with respect to the stator field is given by:

N = (1 - S) * f / p

where N is the rotor speed with respect to the stator field, f is the supply frequency, p is the number of poles, and S is the slip.

Substituting the known values, we get:

N = (1 - 0.067) * 50 / 5

N = 47.33 RPM

Therefore, the speed of the rotor field with respect to the stator field is 47.33 RPM.






10. What is slip of an induction motor

Slip is a term used to describe the difference between the synchronous speed of an induction motor and the actual speed of the rotor. The actual speed of the rotor is always less than the synchronous speed because of the losses and the slip.

The slip of an induction motor is defined as the difference between the synchronous speed (Ns) and the rotor speed (Nr), divided by the synchronous speed, and expressed as a percentage:

Slip = (Ns - Nr) / Ns






11. Explain Why rotor of an induction motor can never attain synchronous speed

 If induction motor runs at synchronous speed, there would be no cutting of the flux by the rotor conductors and there would be no induced EMF, no current and no torque. Therefore, the rotor of the induction motor rotates at a speed slightly less than the synchronous speed

14. What is piezoelectric effect ? Why this effect is only possible in crystals having asymmetrical charge distribution?

The piezoelectric effect is a phenomenon where certain materials generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress or strain. 

The asymmetrical charge distribution is crucial for the piezoelectric effect to occur because it allows for the separation of charges in the crystal lattice. In a crystal with a symmetrical charge distribution, any displacement or deformation would not result in the separation of charges, and therefore no electric charge would be generated 
ex: quartz, Rochelle salt, and tourmaline, exhibit piezoelectricity.






15. Give construction and explain working of Thermo-couple?

A thermocouple is a sensor that measures temperature. It consists of two different types of metals, joined together at one end. When the junction of the two metals is heated or cooled, a voltage is created that can be correlated back to the temperature

Construction of Thermocouple:

A thermocouple consists of two wires made of different metals that are joined together at one end called the measuring junction. The other ends of the wires are joined together at a reference junction. The measuring junction is placed in contact with the object or substance whose temperature is to be measured.

Working of Thermocouple:

When the measuring junction is heated or cooled, a temperature gradient is created across the two junctions, causing a small voltage to be generated due to the Seebeck effect. This voltage is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the hot and cold junctions. 
The voltage generated by the thermocouple is typically very small, in the order of microvolts, and needs to be amplified for measurement purposes. 
The thermocouple can be connected to a measuring instrument, such as a voltmeter, which can measure the small voltage produced by the thermocouple.
